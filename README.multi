Matrix Multiplication using Multithreading in C++

  Description

This project demonstrates the implementation of Matrix Multiplication in C++ using both single-threaded and multi-threaded approaches. It compares the performance of the two methods and prints detailed step-by-step calculations for small matrices.

The project is ideal for understanding multithreading in C++, performance optimization, and element-wise matrix operations.

  Features

  Single-threaded matrix multiplication

  Multithreaded matrix multiplication (one thread per row)

  Performance comparison between both methods

  Element-wise output showing how each matrix element is computed

  Clean, readable output for console display

   Technology Stack

Programming Language: C++

Concepts Used:

Matrix Operations

Performance Measurement (<chrono>)

Element-wise Debug Printing

Vectors and Loops
